                DEPARTURE FOR LONDON.
                ( From our Correspondent ).
                Constantinople, May 29.
                H. H, the Khedive arrived here on Sunday morning, with H.H. the Khediveh, on board the “Amphitrite,” of the Austrian Lloyd. His Highness has, this year, advanced, his arrival at Constantinople at the express desire oi the Sultan, who wished to ask his Highness opinion on the insurrection in the vilayet of Yemen. The Sultan is also desirous of correcting the bad impression caused in Egyptian circles by the last plunder of the Egyptian pilgrims committed in the Hedjaz.
                The Sultan was, graciously pleased to charge Marshal Nouri Pasha, his second chamberlain, and General Husni Pasha, aide-de-camp, to go to meet the Khedive at Tchekmedje, on board the Imperial yacht "Izzedin.”
                The "Amphitrite,” dressed in Ottoman colours, arrived at Tchekuaedje, near San Ste-fano, about 9 a.m. on Sunday and anchored near the "Izzedin.” Marshal Nouri Pasha and General Husni Pasha then proceeded on board and welcomed, the Khedive in the name of the Sultan.
                Soon after, his Highness, accompanied, by Nouri Pasha and Husni Pasha, as well as Zeki Pasha and Toros Pasha, members of hie military household, proceeded on board the Ized-din.” H.H. the Khedivah remained on board the "Amphitrite”. The “Izzedin” and the "Amphitrite” entered the port at 10 a.m. and anchored in front of Dolma Baghtche on the Bosphorus. Being informed of their arrival, the Sultan sent on board the “Izzedin,” Ibrahim Pasha, his grand master of ceremonies, to welcome his Highness. H. E. Ghani Agha, "Dar-us-saddet ul-sherife aghassi” of Yildiz Kiosk, proceeded on boards the “Amphitrite” to salute the Khedivah.
                H.H. the Khedive afterwards, accompanied by the Sovereign’s envoys, landed and drove to the imperial Palace in gala carriages. On arriving there, his Highness was received by the Sultan.
                The Khedive’s mother proceeded on board the steam-launch "Nil” to receive her daughter-in-law and convey her to Bebek.
                H.H. the Khedive is accompanied by Bontros Pasha Ghali, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Zeki Pasha, his master of ceremonies, and Izzet Bey and Chefik Bey, Turkish and French secretaries. During his sojourn in Constantinople General Husni Pasha will act as mihmandar to his Highness.

                THE FIKI QUESTION.
                THE VACCINATION SCARE.
                A KIDNAPPING CASE.
                An educated Sudanese youth, who had obtained the Primary Certificate of the Ministry of Public Instruction, went to Cairo from Assouan to see some of his relations some time ago. He was on his way back again, and when near Gebel Silsileh, the boat in which he was making the journey southwards was becalmed there. Some Bedouins of the village, called Kagoog, came down to the bank of the river and asked the youth to come to their huts in the village and partake of their hospitality until the wind got up. The invitation was accepted and the Sudanese dined with the Bedouins.
                After the meal a fair wind began to blow, and the youth told his hosts that he must be off to his boat and go on his way homewards. But the Bedouins would not let him go, and they bound him with cords and strapped him on the back of a camel. The men then went on their way with the camels across the desert to the shores of the Red Sea, where they sold the boy for £13 to some Bedouins of the Hedjaz. These men resold him to an Arabian for £17 and he remained in a state of slavery for some months.
                But one day he met some Ottoman officials and told them that he was an Egyptian Sudanese and had been wrongfully kidnapped and sold into slavery. The officials took charge of him until the caravan of the Egyptian Mahmal came to Yambo, when they gave him in charge to the leader of the caravan, and told him to take the youth back with him to his own country. So the Sudanese came back to Egypt and was taken to his kinsmen.
                Ahmed Effendi Bekri, of the Repression of Slave Trade Department, has opened an enquiry into the case and the kidnappers have been caught and placed under arrest. They will shortly be tried by court martial.
                REASSURING STATEMENTS
                We are glad to be able to contradict, the report that a death had occurred in Cairo in consequence of a, use of bad lymph in vaccination, and to state that it is entirely without foundation.
                The facts of tip case, to which wo give full publicity op account of its great importance, are as follows. Three men were vaccinated with lymph obtained from a chemist. Two of these three had not been previously vaccinated, whilst the third had been vaccinated in childhood, and the natural consequence was that the lymph acted very strongly in the two former cases, whilst in the latter case the action was very slight.
                One of the men, who had not submitted himself to vaccination in childhood, became feverish and on going into hospital he was examined by two doctors, who. pronounced the case to be one of suspected small-pox. Time however proved that the fever was simply due to the action of the. lymph, and after seventeen days he was dismissed, with a warning to take great care of his vaccinated arm, and on no account to. set up. irritation by scratching it.
                This warning was repeated on the occasion when he visited the hospital for the dressing of the arm, but was apparently unheeded, for on a subsequent visit a scar was found on it. Every attention was paid to the case but in spite of all the patient developed erysipelas, and death ensued.
                From these facts it is perfectly evident that it is altogether wrong to assume that depth was due either to improper vaccination or to the use of bad lymph.
                THE COTTON WORM.
                We understand that at the suggestion of the Ministry of the Interior and the Khedivial Agricultural Society several cultivators are making experiments on small areas with Mr. Richmond's method of destroying the cotton worm, which was fully described in a recent issue of the "Gazette.” It is sincerely to be hoped that these experiments will meet with the success which is anticipated, for the simplicity of the method and the small cost at which it can be carried out will be extremely advantageous to the cotton-grower, and moreover, the solution of the important and difficult problem of how to get rid of the cotton-worm will be an inestimable boon to the country at large.
                Zagazig, Saturday.
                Thu Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior arrived yesterday at Zagazig with Abdel Hamed Bey Abaza, acting Secretary General of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, and immediately went to Kafr-El-Hamam to inspect the work of collecting the cotton worms. He was accompanied by the Mondir of the Shar-kieh province, the Wakeel, the Commandant of Police, and the Mamour of Zagazig district. Mr. Machell was pleased to see that the gathering of the worms was being carried on in a satisfactory manner here. Tbe Adviser returned to the Moudirieh, and after inspecting other work in connection with the cotton worm, he visited Abdel Hamed Bey Abaza’s house, where the Agricultural Society’s office is. There he interviewed Ibrahim Eff. Fahmy, acting secretary of the K.A.S. for Sharkieh, Dakablieh, and Galioubieh provinces. He expressed his satisfaction with the way the work of the society is being carried on.
                The Adviser took some refreshments at Abaza Bey’s house and then accompanied the Moudir to his residence, where he lunched, and left for Cairo by the 3.35 train.

                The Assiout Court has begun the hearing of the Ghirgeh scandal case. The evidence of the incriminated officials, the-Moudir of Ghin geh and the judge of the Mehkejneh Shariah, was heard. They pleaded not guilty.
                Bedawi Bey this morning categorically denied that the, Moudir of Ghirgeh had meddled in his case, or ordered him to sign the procuration. The witnesses have disagreed among themselves in various substantial points, which gives an impression that the case will break down.

                THE PIGMIES.
                The pigmies have arrived in London from Egypt and this (Monday) evening they are to appear at the London Hippodrome. This will be the first time that specimens of the race have journeyed so far from their native haunts.
                In their primitive state in the lagoons and morasses of Central Africa the pigmies have managed to discover a method of smelting iron for the purposes of making spears— their only objects and symbols of wealth. According to the number of spears possessed by a tribesman, so is his social status estimated. He even barters these for a wife. Females are married at the age of eight, and are considered in the prime of life at twelve years. At forty years both sexes are considered patriarchal.

The highest successful total was 129 1/2 and the lowest successful total 78 1/2. 0f the, remaining candidates six absented themselves during the examination, two were expelled for fraud, the rest (270) failed. Of 195 pupils* prepared at the Government schools 114 passed ; of 130 pupils prepared at private* schools 53 were successful, while of 122 private pupils only ten satisfied the examiners.
                In the French section there were. 208 candidates (61 successful). In the English section there were 239 candidates (116 successful).
                We understand that, in order to prevent what is known as “cramming” the examination papers are not printed, but if rumour may be trusted, the geometry paper proved a stum-, bling block to many. That the examiners do not err on the side of leniency may be inferred from the fact that the proportion of unsuccess, ful candidates, is a fraction under 601/2 per cent. The largest number of successful candi-dates come from the Government schools,while the private pupils are particularly unfortunate We confess to some sympathy for the latter who, from the nature of the case, are Undoubtedly earnest students. In all examination! conducted by the Civil Service Commissioner! in England the papers are printed. “Cramming’f may beat be avoided by well framed questions which, when published, form a useful guide to such candidates as are obliged to grope after troth without the assistance of experienced teachers.

                ALEXANDRIA POLICE  VASCO VELLA.
                On Saturday an interesting case, of assault terminated before the British Consular Court at Alexandria, the defendant being a broker on the Bourse and the complainant, the Alexandria City Police, who alleged that a policeman and a ghaffir had been assaulted by the broker. It appears that on the evening of 28th May Messrs. Yasoo Vella, a Maltese and a British subject, and Pio Tonna, a Maltese,were together in the Savoy Bar on the Ramleh-boulevard. Vella went into a lane adjoining the bar and attempted to-commit a nuisance, which the ghaffir, Ismail Aly, would not let him perform. The broker became indigent and struck the ghaffir. A policeman and the broker also assaulted him. The policeman was so badly assaulted that he had to be taken to hospital.
                The case was heard on Friday and judgment was given on Saturday last, the defendant being fined £10 for the assault on the policeman ’in the execution of his duty, £1 for a simple assault on the ghaffir, and costs.
