                                heightened by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman s subsequent declaration
                                that any Liberal Government would follow faithfully and zealously
                                Lord Lansdowne’s policy. The 'Times” proceeds that we are confident

                                peace in Asia than a solid alliance between Great Britain and Japan

                                ultimo. It has been formed with the object of takingNiyer from the
                                parent company an area of 9,000 feddans of laud situated on the west
                                bank of the Nile and extending northwards from Ras el Khahg. As this
                                property stands at present it may be divided into four parts
                                according to its condition, as fully cultivated, partly cultivated,
                                fallow, and wastes Of the fuLy cultivated land there are 2,100
                                feddans, which it is expected will in 1906 yield an income of about
                                £4,500. Although the remaining 7,000 feddans consist of three
                                different qualities of land, in estimating the probable return to be
                                had from them it has been wisely determined to regard the whole as
                                conbktiug of land reqairing reclamation. The prospects thus obtained
                                are therefore bated upon a very moderate estimate of the probabie
                                returns and will almost certainly be exceeded in the aotual working.
                                Prior to the purchase of this property, Sir William Willcocks
                                caretuUy examined an4 reported most favorably upon a large tract of

                                acquire. The purchase of this is, however,\in abeyance owing to the
                                decision of the Government not to sell any large parcel of its lands
                                at present The capital of the company has been fixed at £400,000,
                                the whole of which has been subscribed, and it is anticipated that
                                in 1913 the company will have realised from sales and revenues large
                                profits and will be in a position to pay a dividend exoeeding 10%
                                from the ►,000 feddans that will then remain in its possession. As
                                we have indicated, the probable profits have been purposely
                                estimated below the figures that might have been assumed if the
                                company had been actuated by no other desir* than that of presenting
                                its prospects in the most favorable light, but the course followed
                                by the company is one deserving of the hight est commendation and
                                one that cannot fail to add largely to the interest that will

                                convicted of dealing in slaves during the course of the past year.
                                Of these, one (Ibrahim Wad Mah-moud; was sentenced to death for
                                murder and rebellion. The remaining sixteen were condemned to
                                various terms of imprisonment. The fear which the application of the
                                law has* inspired produces, without doubt, a salutary effeot on the
                                whole, bat it sometimes leads to sad consequences. As regards
                                Sudanese domestic slavery, as distinguished from the slavtf trade,
                                as much progress as could reasonably be expected is being made in
                                eradicating this institution from the country. By carefully
                                protecting the interests of those who were previously slaves, and it
                                the same time gradually employing them on remunerative work in other
                                capacities— should they be unwilling to return to their masters as
                                ordinary servants—the authorities will eventually,with the
                                concurrence and assistance of the inhabitants themselves, gradually
                                transform the status of slavery, and substitute for it a system of
                                paid labour, whioh will probably bo acceptable to master and servant
                                alike. Captain McMurdo's inspection in the south-t3rn Sudan will
                                lead to the control of the slave traffic in those far off regions.
                                The slave raiding cases, which occur in that part of the Sudan,
                                appear to be more in the way of reprisals arising from tribal
                                quarrels than for purposes of export. When the machinery of the
                                Slave Trade Repression Department throughout the Sudan is
                                satisfactorily organised, slavery will have reoeived its

                            <p>“Nothing is more encouraging to the fiscal reformer,” says Lord
                                Cromer in dealing with the subject of Nile Navigation in his last
                                Report, “than to observe the manner in which the country responds to
                                any measures taken, in the direction of the relief of fiscal
                                burthens.” The allusion is to the extraordinarily large increase
                                which has taken plaoe in the boat traffio on the Nile since the look
                                tolls were removed. The traffio is growing enormously, but the
                                figures are not available, save in one case—that of the locks at the
                                Delta Barrage. In 1845^15,867 boats passed through this look. At the
                                close of 1900, the tolls were removed. In 1903, no less than 35,732
                                boats passed through the look. In 1904, the number increased to
                                41,740. At the Kasr-el-Nil bridge at Cairo, the officials in charge
                                have given op trying to oount the boats. They pass through in such a
                                rush and in suoh dose order, that it is impossible to oount them.
                                These facts and figures, imperfeot though they be, are sufficient to
                                show that there has been an enormous increase in the river traffic.
                                It will almost certainly develop still further, now t^hat the
                                lioense fees on boats have been removed It is, however, to be
                                anticipated that every year steam-bargcs—of which there are already
                                a considerable number—will take the place of sailing-boats. We
                                regret to state, however, that there is a great deal of abuse in
                                oonneotion with the tonnage measurements and a wide-spread system of
                                fraud is in vogue. A Cairo correspondent gives the following
                                examples of the abuse. We quota his letter in fall “In connection
                                with the recent interest taken in matters of navigation on the Nile,
                                1 wish to draw attention to a long-standing abuse whioh it is high
                                time shoald be stopped. I refer to the tonnage measurement of native
                                boats, for which, as you maybe aware, certificates are issued by the
                                Government, in the form of receipts for the navigation dues. In
                                selling or purchasing produce, etc., or chartering boats, it is the
                                custom to use these reoeipts very often as the basis of the
                                transaction, which is a oonvenienoe and economises time and trouble.
                                Now comes in the abuse. I have myself seen i^the hands of boatmen,
                                two different certificates for the same boat, showing a very
                                considerable difference in the tonnage. The second one, which is as
                                much as fifty or a hundred ardebs less than the actual measurement,
                                is of course used in purchasing, and the other in selling or
                                chartering. The false one is of oourse obtained by the use of the
                                inevitable nimble dollar, but considering the amounts involved I
                                think it is high time a refonn ii made. I would therefore, whilst
                                apologising for occupying your valuable spaoe, ask your assistance
                                in drawing attention to this matter, with a view to the
                                establishment ot some satisfactory standard of tonnage.” </p>

                            this morning under the presidency of Mohamad Bey Saleh, assisted by
                            Hassan Bey Husny and Abdul Aziz Bey Mohamed, the clerk being Abdul Hamid
                            Eff. Hamdi. The attendance in Court was very large, many having oomespe.
                            cially from Cairo, the Fayoum, and Sohag, where the Moudir is v.
                            ell-known. The president announced the opening of the sitting, after
                            which the names of the were called out and they were given chairs to sit
                            on during the trial. The names of the wit-were then called out and these
                            were accommodated in a special room. There were eleven witnesses for the
                            proeeoution and twelve for the defence. After the usual interrogatories
                            of the aooos-ed the Substitut called for the application of Article 180
                            of the Penal Code against them. The aoonsed were then asked as to
                            whether they were guilty or not guilty of the charge, and it is
                            ioportant to give here the answers of each. The Cadi Shari and the two
                            witnesses of the tawkil, as well as Kamel flft>Waesif(the wekil of the
                            daireh), asserted that the tawkil was genuine. Mohamed Bey Rifi’a
                            deposed that he was in Cairo and therefore could not tell whether his
                            father had signed the tawkil or not, but he thought he must have signed
                            it as he had intended doing so^ The Moudir asserted that he knew nothing
                            about it, that he was not present, and so could not tell whether it was
                            genuine or a forgery. The clerk then read out the charge^heet, aftes
                            which the witnesses were heard. The most important witnesses were Badawy
                            Bey Rifa’at, Sheikh Ahmed Mansour (the clerk who wrote out the tawkil),
                            and Mohamed Eff. Farghali, son-in-law of Badawy Bey. All ed, of course,
                            that the tawkil was forged but it is very important to note one or two
                            points in the testimony of Badawy Bey. The Moudir is aconsed of having
                            ordered Badawy £ey to sign the-tawkil, telling him that it was a
                            register of the Moudirieh oonoeming the property^ the daira. Badawy Bey,
                            iil his evidence, asserted that the Moudir had not ordered him to sign,
                            nor did he say anything, but was merely present K»m*il who had asked him
                            to sign. The clerk of the Mehkemeh asserted also that “a gentleman” (he
                            did not know whether it was the Moudir or some one else) had asked
                            Badawy Bey to sign. But Moh. Eff. Farghali stated that Badawy told him
                            that he signed through the influenoe of the Moudir. The hearing
                            continued at 9 o’olook in the evening. To-morrow the rest of the
                            witnesses will be heard and the pleadings will take plaoe on Tuesday.
                            (By Telegraph). Assiout, Monday afternoon. The Court today heard the
                            evidence of the Commandant of Polioe, who was present with the Moudir in
                            the house of BaaawiBey. He declared that the Moadir was not oonoerned in
                            the matter either bv his verhal orders or by the exertion of his
                            innaenoe.</p>

                        <p> ( From our ^Correspondent ). Fayoum, Sunday. The moudirieh oonncil has
                            sentenced tbe omdeh ofBiohmo to three months’imprisonment for his
                            conduct in the recent brigandage case. Many people consider the sentence
                            a harsh one, as during the 15 years he has acted as omdeh there have
                            been no previous complaints as to the way in which he has carried out
                            his duties, and he has, in fact, been officially commended for the way
                            in which he has performed them. No doubt his oondnct was cowardly on the
                            ocoasion of the attaok on Soliman Said’s house, but the experience was a
                            trying one for him. He has been unaccustomed to use firearms, and the
                            suddenness of the outrage caused him to lose his presence of mind.
                            Perhaps the oounoil thought that by making an example of him they would
                            warn other omdebs of the necessity of being prepared to act in cases of
                            emergenoy. These brigands, instead of being imprisoned, should be sent
                            away out of the oountry to the Su^an. They belong to an organised body
                            who furnish the means for their defenoe, ard provide for the families of
                            any who get caught and imprisoned. The State has to pay for their
                            maintenance in prison, and no good whatever is effected by sending them
                            tbere. Let them be sent right away instead.</p>
