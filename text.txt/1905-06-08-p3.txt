OBITUARY.
DR. ELMER LANSING.
It is with great regret that we record .the death of Dr. Elmer Lansing, which occurred at the German Hospital, Cairo, on Tuesday evening. Dr. Lansing was well-known in his profession as a specialist in eye-diseases, and his loss will be keenly felt by his colleagues and by his numerous friends. He was one of the oldest of the American residents in Egypt and for many years lived at Helouan, where his geniality and kindness gained lor him a large circle of friends and admirers. The funeral service was held at the Mortuary Chapel of the German Hospital at 4 o’clock yesterday afternoon and was attended by the greater part of the American colony in Cairo. Dr. Lansing leaves behind him a widow and daughter, who have spent their lives in Cairo and Helouan with him, and two sons, who are at college in America. We extend our heart-felt sympathy and sincere condolences to the bereaved family.

ESBEKIEH GARDENS.
It is reported from Athens that the negotiations between the Egyptian and Hellenic Governments relative to the new commercial treaty have not come to a satisfactory conclusion. The existing treaty will remain in force until March 31, 1906, i.e., for an extra period of ten months.
FAYOUM LIGHT RAILWAY.
Sinkat is a very healthy and cool station and it is proposed to erect a very fine Government Hospital there, on the lines of a sanatorium. All officers and Government officials will be sent there from all parts of the Sudan as convalescents to recruit their health, instead of, as now, being sent to the Cairo military and oivil hospitals.
It is rumoured that both lines from the Atbara and Suakin will be joined by the end of September, 1905, but that it will not be open to traffic until the early part of 1907, in order to give the whole line time to consolidate, so as secure it against heavy rains and floods. All the bridges, numbering hundreds, will be completed by that time.
The British steamor “Tabaristan” arrived here from England on the 26th inst with a special consignment of coal and other railway material for the Sudan Government Railways.
The Khedivial mail steamer “ Missir ” arrived here from Suez on the 29th inst. and landed the following new railway offioials who are to be employed on the Suakin-Atbara line : Mr. Albert Cree (of Alexandria), to take over the appointment of Traffic Inspector ; Mr. Hewson, Assistant Loco. Superintendent, and Mr. Wap, engineer in charge of oondensors. Mr. Warn has brought his wife and children with him.
It is with great regret that I have to record the death of Mulazim Awal Abdil-meghid Effendi Hilmy, Sudan Government Railways, which took place yesterday at his residence in Suakin, from appendicitis. He had been for some time in the Civil Hospital and was operated on by Doctors Crispin and Fahmy. Abdilmeghid Effendi was a member of the board of officers of the Sudan Railways here, and spoke English fluently. He was a promisingyoung officer,andVery much esteemed by all his friends. He leaves a widow and children here to mourn his loss. His funeral took place early this morning, and was attended by a large number of offioers from the railways, the Moudirieh, and the 6th Battalion Egyptian Army. The firing party was furnished by the 6 th Battalion.
It is also with regret that I have to report the serious illness of Mr. Smart, chief storekeeper, Suakin-Atbara line, who has been laid up with high fever since the 28th inst.

The wind was moderate from the N.N.W. The “Sula II.” of the “Commodore’' in Class L
"walked” dean away from all the other boats and came in an easy first, and therefore carried off Chitty Bey’s cup. This boat will raoe next week under the name of “Sans-Pareille” u she has changed owners, and now belongs .to Mr. H. de Tsohudi. The “May” brought op the rear, and it is a pity that in doing so she should have forced her right-of-way with the winning boats ot the other olass as thereby she herself gained nothing and imperilled their ohanoes.
In Class II. the “Calypso” unfortunately crossed the line too soon end had to return and recross, thereby losing over a minute j moreover she is not placed until the question of her forcing “Sula II.” at the “black and white” buoy is decided by the sailing committee.
After the races the “Gumrook,” with a “rais” in charge, unfortunately ran into the “Ironie” and Mr. P. Girard very narrowly escaped being injured by her bowsprit, but got off with a few bruises only.
The finish of Class II. was a very pretty one, when seven boats crossed the line within If minutes, thus showing a handicap which it will be difficult to improve.
Next week the regatta will start half an hour later than the present starting tima
