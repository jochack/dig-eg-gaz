MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1905.
Egypt is so deeply interested Is confiued to a single undertaking, the property of the Suuj, a monopoly, and in most respects the simjiie-t possible machine of its kind and to the remedying of its defects and wants, which ^re as clear as the day. Mr. Robertson's rejurt • was upon the best method of dealing with & number of the most complicated problems which could possibly arise out of a multipli ity of different lines, owners* rights, interests at-. Mr. Priestly’s was simply upon the part ff any, of the American systems of railway working which could with advantage be introduced into India. Taking these reports agaiu in the same order, we oertainly have fair reason to he • lieve that the first has been accepted by .those best able to judge as fulfilling its purpose aud, so far as we know/ its recommendations are now being provided for as far and as fast as circumstanoes permit, but nothing of .the sort can be said of either of the others. It is true an Indian Railway Board has been formed, bat this had been proposed and discussed form my years before Mr. Robertson ever went to India, and it was not formed as proposed by him “somewhat - imperfectly1' according to “Traffic," but more wisely so, according to Lord Curzon and his advisers. The division of a railway nnder ‘ Traffic Management ’ seems to us too amateurish to consider, and finds no place in our reading of Lord Farrar's Report Traffic itself is a department only. As the earning one its place. and its efficieut management are all-important—its wants must be administered to by all, but it does not, aud never should, take' the place of “General Management.” We would wish to make ourselves dear. The success of a railway depends more upon traffic management than anything else. All other things being equal, probably the best General Manager is a traffic man,‘but in either capacity, his qualifications depend upon his business aptitude and business experience. Sach do not usually comprise any civil or mechanical engineering knowledge, and that traffic qu;i traffic should have these or other departments or sections of these under its heel is an unheard-of proposition. There are points in connection with this division, as advocated by “Traffic/^ which remin4 ns of the “Horse,” “K^frijStimeut,: and some other departments of sojne 'English railways. By thus misnaming separate sections the number may go far beyond eleven, but happily for share-holders and for,management, the number of departments proper is kept dowu at about half this number, and Lord Farrar s report gives their generally accepted constitution. In their details we cannot either accept many of “Traffic’s” expressed opinions. Surely in its provisions for stock and station accom modation Lord Farrar’s Commission supplies what is necessary for working the present and immediately prospective; in regard to “General Management," the idea has been that there are too many at it, not that it is done at present mainly by the tiaffio manager, and the creation of a capital aooount hardly heads the list in the matter of improved financial control. As a matter of fact we have not been in anyway (or by anything that has happened^ prepared tor adverse criticism of the Commission’s suggestions ,for improving the condition, of our. railways and their workings. In our leading articles on the issne of the Report we referred to special difficulties in carrying them out, and what is now happening proves their existence, but we have confidence, and signs of the determination of the authorities to act on and op to the advice of the authority aooepted(even by “Traffic”) in the shape of Lord Farrar’s Commission are not wanting.
WHAT ENGLISHWOMEN WANT.
EGYPTIAN RAILWAY REFORM.
During the past month our oolumns have oontained three articles on the Egyptian State Railways, by ‘'Traffic.’’ The subjeot is one so full of interest and importance to this country, that we welcome such contributions, provided they are of a nature to promote the interests involved either directly or indireotly, but their acceptance by ns for publication involves the challenging of opinions which we cannot endorse. From onr contributor’s reference to the reports of Mr. Thomas Robertson and Mr. Neville Priestly on Indian and American Railways respectively, our readers might be led to believe that there is something in oommon between them and that of Lord Farrar’s Commission. This is not so. The report in whioh
Mr. Robert Hichens asks, in “ The Queen," whether women like to be free. “Some years ago,” he says, “there seemed to be a new unrest in the world of Englishwomen; they seemed to be dissatisfied with the existing conditions of their livee, to want a greater emancipation. . . . Women were to be this and were to be that. They were to enter all the professions. They were to sit in Parliament They were to wear trousers if they pleased, and they did—a few of them—wear those frightful garments called ‘divided skirts,’ at which when
I	looked I sometimes desired their death, for in death they shall not be divided. There was a cropping of hair and a wearing of shirt collars, and.a good deal of swaggering that was suppos-be ‘manly.’ And the old-fashioned women cned, ‘What are we coming to ? ’ And some of us men echoed the wail in bass voices, but with acnte anxiety. And what has it all ended in—or shall I say it all ending in I Smoke, the smoke of the (figarette, or reaction I
"Do women as a whole—the great majority of women, that is—wieh to be free I Women themselves often make me doubt it There are certainly women who passionately rebel against any attempt on the part of men at dominion, even at guidance. Bat are they typical, or are they, on the contrary, exceptional women ' My observation leads me to suppose that they are not typical at all Being a man, I find it extremely difficult to understand how any humnu being can take pleasure in being ruled, but I have certainly met numbers of women, and many of them women of strong character, who obviously enjoyed being ruled, who even Fought a ruler instinctively, as if their natures needed jost that—governance, a master, someone who said to them, ‘I am stronger than you. Von must reoognise that fact. Yon must play second fiddle to my first’ ’’
